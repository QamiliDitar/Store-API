# Store-API
Developed a store API using Express and MongoDB, featuring robust controllers and routes. Utilized Postman for testing, implemented Mongoose schema models, and automated data additions. Included filtering methods for sorting, selecting, and paginating data, enhancing my API development and database management skills.
